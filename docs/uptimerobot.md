Setup UptimeRobot
=================

The external service https://uptimerobot.com allows to monitor a website
availability. We can use it to ensure that at least a machine and nginx works:
e.g. set https://lists.tarantool.org/mailman/listinfo as an URL to perform
periodic HTTPS probes. This can be done using the [web
interface](https://uptimerobot.com) (registration is required).
